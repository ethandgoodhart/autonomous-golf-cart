"""
cartlib.follow — autonomous GPS path following for the cart.

A conservative cross-track controller that ties the RTK position to steering
and throttle WITHOUT ever computing a GPS heading:

  * Steering is a heading-free cross-track PD law. ``signed_distance_m`` from
    the path geometry tells us which side of the line we're on (and how far);
    its rate of change supplies the damping term that a heading would normally
    provide (cross_rate ~= v * sin(heading_error), so PD on
    (cross, cross_rate) is a Stanley-style law that needs no world heading).
    The cart's own steering-wheel angle sensor closes the inner loop.
  * Throttle ramps toward ``max_speed_mph`` using the live GPS speed as
    feedback, hard-capped at ``gas_cap`` and backed off in sharp turns.
  * Throttle is cut to zero (with brake) at the goal.

SAFETY — this AUTONOMOUSLY DRIVES THE CART. The follower:
  * caps gas at ``gas_cap`` (default = FSD_GAS_LIMIT, 0.25),
  * stops on e-stop, on lost/old GPS, on excessive cross-track error, and at
    the final waypoint,
  * defaults to DRY-RUN (computes + prints, sends nothing) unless armed.

Path format: a list of (lat, lon) tuples. ``load_path`` accepts JSON in the
drivelive ({lat,lng}), lane_tracker (fix dicts with lat/lon), or plain
[[lat,lon], ...] shapes.
